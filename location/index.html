				<div class = "text">
					Much of the street parking in Berkeley is limited to 2 hours or requires a city permit. Some of these permit areas (such as on the north side of campus) do not apply on weekends so you may be able to find street parking for free. However, there are many parking garages near campus which either charge a flat rate for the day or an hourly rate which is capped at a certain point.
					<br>
					<br>Recommended garages:
