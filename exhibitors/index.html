Please be patient with us the earlier you arrive, as we are also just beginning to set up our registration software at that time! The convention closes officially at 8PM, and we generally stay in the space until 10PM for clean up. Please pack up as soon as possible so we can help out and get staff out in a timely manner! If you need to leave earlier than 8PM, that is acceptable as well!
