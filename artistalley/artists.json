A lot of my art is ghibli and nintendo based but I dabble in some cute flower designs once in a while. I am open to customs from all realms but I usually like to stick to animated characters as opposed to hyperrealistic art.\n\nMy favorite anime is Scissor Seven (with Aggretsuko being a close contender) but lately I've been on a video game grind and have been playing a lot of Stardew and Overwatch.\n\nI hope you find something you love!",

      "description": "Hi there! I'm Cozy, a digital artist, and I enjoy making art that feels more painterly! I love dramatic lighting and ruffles! My favorite anime are HunterxHunter, D.Gray-Man, Jojo, and 91 Days! I'm involved in a lot of fandoms, and I love making art for series I'm enjoying. I'm working on making acrylic stands, other new fun merch, finishing up and starting new illustrations for prints, and character designs for my upcoming comic project!\n\nFor this artist alley: if you are local to the Berkley area, you can come pick up your purchases instead of having them shipped to you! No need to pay for shipping! Please head over to the artist alley discord and I'll give you more information on how that will work as well as what items I have in stock!",

I enjoy a lot of mecha animes although I lack the discipline and precision to draw them so I have been having fun with drawing just regular characters. I've been interested in Fate Grand Order characters recently and am working on drawings of Kama and Tamamo right now.",
